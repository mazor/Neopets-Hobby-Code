# Neopets-Hobby-Code
Code I made for pet pages for my guild (Chillin Critters) in neopets. 

These are two competitions I hosted for my guild in neopets. 
I created the pages (Spookfest was the first created and was edited from a template, SummerFest was done by myself). 
The two events were dress up competitions.  

The run code can be seen at 
SpookFest: (My first attempt at hosting a competition like this)
http://www.neopets.com/~A_Tiny_Sweet_Pea
which has subsections like http://www.neopets.com/~A_Tiny_Sweet_Pea#Champions etc.

SummerFest: (My favourite and most recent)
http://www.neopets.com/~TheCrimsonComet 
which has subsections like http://www.neopets.com/~TheCrimsonComet#Champions etc.
